Subject: I built this for you

Hey [Name],

I saw your mail in my database for my panic companion/Attack Insurance, as I like to call it.

I've been working on this project for a bit, and I hand-picked a few random people to get genuine feedback for my app.

Would you like to give it a shot?

Reply to this email if yes.

Thanks,
Arwin (a.k.a. ThePythonNerd on Reddit)
